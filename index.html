            <p>Hello! Welcome to the resume of Olivia Albin :)</p>
            <br />

<section id="about">
    <h4><b>About</b></h4>
    <p>I am 23 and a third-year user experience design student at Laurier that aspires to work on inspiring, impactful projects in the UX and service design fields.</p>
    <p>Along with my primary studies, I am also currently working towards minors in psychology and community health, both of which inform
        my design work as well as enrich my understanding of people which is key to good design.</p>
    <p>Aside from this, I have a great interest in the science, especially biology and environmental science. This passion led me to enroll in the life sciences
        program at McMaster University until I realized the versatility and creativity of design is better path for me. I hope to be able to merge these two worlds
        my future career path, working in both design and the sciences.</p>

    <h4><b>Education</b></h4>
    <br />
    <h5>High School</h5>
    <b>McKinnon Park Secondary School — OSSD</b>
    <p>September 2012 - June </p>
    <p>In high school I was part of various clubs that were involved in the community and was an honour student for all 4 academic years.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>University</h5>
    <b>Wilfrid Laurier University — BDes</b>
    <p>September 2019 - Present (Graduate Spring 2023)</p>
    <p>Laurier's 4-year User Experience (UX) Design program primarily teaches various skills intended to prepare graduates for a 
        career in the web and product design field including courses on topics such as design thinking, user research, web and graphic 
        design, project management, and interaction design.<br />
        In pursuing this degree I continue to learn the value of hard work, determination, communication, and creative thinking that I 
        feel all translate to applications outside of school as well in the job positions I fill. </p>
    <p>Throughout my time at Laurier, I have maintained a position on the Dean's Honour Role.</p>

        <p>Working as a line cook, I participate in making each order for in-house customers as well as take out orders. Each day,

            structure and the opportunity to add value to a team and to a customer's experience.</p>
        <p>As a prep cook, I assist in stocking, portioning, preparing backups, and preparing some ingredients and pre-made menu items. 
            In this role, I am able to work quickly and independently to ensure that line operations run as smoothly possible.</p>
